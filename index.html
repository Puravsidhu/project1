            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The concept of television is the work of many individuals in the late
                19th and early 20th centuries. The first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system
                used mechanical rotating perforated disks to scan a scene into a time-varying signal that could be
                reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original image. Development of television
                was interrupted by the Second World War. After the end of the war, all-electronic methods of scanning
                and displaying images became standard. Several different standards for addition of color to transmitted
                images were developed with different regions using technically incompatible signal standards. Television
                broadcasting expanded rapidly after World War II, becoming an important mass medium for advertising,
                propaganda, and entertainment.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Prior to electric televisions, we had mechanical televisions.

                These early televisions started appearing in the early 1800s. They involved mechanically scanning images
                then transmitting those images onto a screen. Compared to electronic televisions, they were extremely
                rudimentary.
                <br>
                One of the first mechanical televisions used a rotating disk with holes arranged in a spiral pattern.
                This device was created independently by two inventors: Scottish inventor John Logie Baird and American
                inventor Charles Francis Jenkins. Both devices were invented in the early 1920s.
                <br>
                Prior to these two inventors, German inventor Paul Gottlieb Nipkow had developed the first mechanical
                television. That device sent images through wires using a rotating metal disk. Instead of calling the
                device a television, however, Nipkow called it an “electric telescope”. The device had 18 lines of
                resolution
